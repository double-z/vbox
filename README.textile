h1. VBox

Vbox is a web-app front-end for management of VirtualBox on a headless server.

I've only just started making it, and for the moment I'm only concerned with the
features that I personally want. I'd be happy for others to contribute.

VBox is written in Ruby on Rails.

h2. Todo

h3. Security

* Figure out how to insert VM names onto command line without risking 
  command-injection

h3. Functionality

* Delete hard drives
* Resize guest RAM
* More comprehensive support for hardware (I'm having trouble deleting machines
    that weren't created with the current code, cause they still have devices
    attached [turned out to be the floppy drive])

h3. View

* "Are you sure?" boxes whenever doing irreversible things (delete, shutdown, etc)
* No more dragging ISOs and drives -- sometimes VMs are off-screen
* Make it less ugly
* Show details about host disk usage
